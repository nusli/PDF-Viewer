#PDF-previewer
This is a project I built in an internship. It goes through all directories in the app-directory, extracts the first page of every pdf-file it finds and displays them.

##Technologies
It is build on the backend with PHP and the Ghostscript and Imagemagick libraries.
For the frontend I used jQuery and Font-Awesome libraries.
